# Overview

This project is to help me learn and understand what Kotlin is and how it is used to develop today's Android Apps. 

This android app is a basic "To-Do's" List where the user can add tasks that they need to do for the day. Along with adding, the user can also mark the completed tasks and delete them.

The purpose of writing this software is to understand why Kotlin is such an efficient language for developing apps.
